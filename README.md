Give me 1000 stars thank you
edit: i just realised that the average dev is not going to understand whats going on because pycurl is not used like this in the docs and you need a working curl version for windows maybe i will make a repo for it...

 works fine on LINUX just do sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev and then do pip install pycurl <3
