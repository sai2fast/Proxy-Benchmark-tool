This program basically checks how many unique IPs a rotating pool has and what kind of IPs it stores statistics about IP location data and more to text files. 
enjoy this amazing beautiful code.

edit: i just realised that the average dev is not going to understand whats going on because pycurl is not used like this in the docs and you need a working curl version for windows maybe i will make a repo for it...

 works fine on LINUX just do sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev and then do pip install pycurl <3
